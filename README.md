A sine wave that can be used on a web page to make it dynamic. Has a controller that allows for editing of the wave length,
amplitude and frequency properties of a sine wave.


# What I learnt

1. The use of the canvas element with JavaScript to draw sine wave graphics.
2. How to add a controller that allows you to edit the sine wave individual properties such as the amplitude, wave length and frequency.
